A folder that holds scripts to generate the diffs in toggles and settings between arbitrary releases.

* ``sumac-xml``: The ``_build/xml`` directory from the edx-platform docs build for the Sumac release.
  Note in this folder, the XML needed for the diff scripts is: ``sumac-xml/references/featuretoggles.xml`` and ``sumac-xml/references/settings.xml``
  This path is the same for pre-Sumac releases, but has changed in Teak.
