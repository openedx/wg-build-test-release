            <paragraph>Over many years work has been underway to extract frontend code from
                edx-platform, to be replaced by MFEs.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Additionally, as of March 2025, edx-platform had more than 700 violations in
                ESLint.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For more details on the MFE replacement, see:</paragraph>

            <title>Decision</title>
            <paragraph>Over these years of work, it was decided that all frontend code should
                ultimately be removed from edx-platform. Until this time, there has not yet
                been a single ADR or DEPR to capture this decision.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This decision record is to document this past decision. It is ok to add
                additional links or details over time to clarify how this extraction will be
                accomplished, or to one day celebrate its completion.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Additionally, it has been decided to preemptively remove ESLint. This will
                ensure that engineers can stay focused on higher priority work, rather than
                spending time fixing linting issues in JavaScript that will simply be removed.
                This removal is important because github has started posting these violations
                in github comments that make this work seem like a priority. At the very least,
                these are annoying messages that clutter up PRs.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>We will continue to replace all frontend code in edx-platform with an
                appropriate set of MFEs.</paragraph>
