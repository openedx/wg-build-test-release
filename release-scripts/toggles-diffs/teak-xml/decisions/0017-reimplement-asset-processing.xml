                <paragraph><emphasis>Note: this table excludes HTML templates. Templates are part of the frontend, but they are dynamically rendered by the Web application and therefore must be handled differently than static assets.</emphasis></paragraph>
                <paragraph>So, with the exception of XBlock fragments and pip-installed assets, which are very simple for edx-platform to handle, we plan to eventually remove all edx-platform static frontend assets. However, given the number of remaining edx-platform frontends and speed at which they are currently being replatformed, estimates for completion of this process range from one to five years. Thus, in the medium term future, we feel that timeboxed improvements to how edx-platform handles static assets are worthwhile, especially when they address an acute pain point.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>We could avoid committing any work to edx-platform asset tooling, and instead just wait until all frontends have been replatformed into MFEs. See the <emphasis>Context</emphasis> section above for why this was rejected.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Rather than replace it, we could try to improve the existing Paver-based asset processing system. However, entirely dropping Paver and mostly dropping Python has promising benefits:</paragraph>

                    <title>Asset build independence</title>
                    <paragraph>When building a container image, we want to be able to build static assets without first copying any Python code or requirements lists from edx-platform into the build context. That way, only changes to system requirements, npm requirements, or the assets themselves would trigger an asset rebuild.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>The asset pipeline only needs to perform a handful of simple tasks, primarily copying files and invoking shell commands. It does NOT need to be extensible, as we do not want new frontend features to be added to the edx-platform repository. On the contrary, simplicity and obviousness of implementation are virtues. Bash is particularly suited for these sort of scripts.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>However, Python (like any modern application language) encourages developers to modularize, build abstractions, use clever control flow, and employ indirection. This is particularly noticeable with the Paver assets build, which is a thousand lines long and difficult to understand.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>It is best if the build can stem from a single call to <literal>npm install &amp;&amp; npm run build</literal> rather than a call to a bespoke script (whether Paver or Bash). Generally speaking, the more edx-platform can work with standard frontend tooling, the easier it’ll be for folks to use, understand, and maintain it.</paragraph>
