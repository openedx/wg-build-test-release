            <title>Context</title>
            <paragraph>The Open edX platform allows advanced course authors to write customized problem scoring code in Python. This has long been an area of strength, but it comes with significant operational issues, security risk, and long term maintenance burdens for both the authors and platform developers.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Recent advancements in WebAssembly (Wasm) give us an opportunity to give course teams even more powerful capabilities for trusted server-side grading, while being safer, faster, and easier to maintain. Third party package support is not yet at a level where we can make a drop-in replacement for codejail, but we can still build the infrastructure that would make it possible, as well as offer exciting new capabilities.</paragraph>
            <section ids="why-webassembly" names="why\ webassembly?">
                <title>Why WebAssembly?</title>
                <paragraph>Code sandboxing currently happens using codejail, an AppArmor-based sandboxing mechanism that either runs on the same server as Studio/LMS, or runs on a separate server. This current system has worked for us for some time, but it has a number of drawbacks that WebAssembly is well positioned to address.</paragraph>
                <section ids="security" names="security">
                    <title>Security</title>
                    <paragraph>In the current system, simple misconfigurations can be dangerous, since we’re running a full instance of Python and relying on properly setting up codejail and AppArmor to constrain it.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>WebAssembly was created with safe execution in mind. When running Wasm code, it will by default have no access to the network or host filesystem.</paragraph>

                    <title>Maintenance</title>
                    <paragraph>Content lasts longer than software, and authors don’t expect to have to update their scoring code. When Python 2.7 was approaching its end-of-life, it was a large effort to get people to test their content with Python 3. Some of that content is probably forever broken. While this is an extreme example, there will be smaller breakages over time–libraries that get upgraded because the old versions are no longer available, Python versions that get updated because operating systems stop offering end-of-life versions, etc.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>The big advantage Wasm provides here is that it can treat these software packages as <emphasis>data</emphasis>. If we have a Wasm binary file that holds a compiled version of Python and all relevant packages, then we no longer have to worry about upgrades or whether we can offer exactly those libraries in the future. We just keep the same binary around going forward.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>We could still offer upgraded packages for new capabilities, but these would be purely opt-in. You could specify which system you wanted to use in your problem and have confidence that the content would never require updating. So you could specify that this particular problem should use the “python-sci-2024” stack (which maps to a stable Python+libraries release compiled to Wasm), and two years from now, you might make another problem that uses the “python-sci-2026” stack.</paragraph>

                    <title>Flexibility of Additional Runtimes</title>
                    <paragraph>When the sandboxed runtime environment is just a Wasm file, it makes it much easier for us to support multiple runtimes with the same service and add new ones as necessary. These runtimes can even be in different languages.</paragraph>

                    <title>Operations</title>
                    <paragraph>The Wasmtime library gives a more precise accounting of the resources being used by allotting computation budget “fuel” and measuring how much a given Wasm program has used. This is more precise than the limits that AppArmor uses, which can sometimes result in problems that work fine most of the time but start failing under elevated system load. The fact that we have precise measurements of how much fuel is being used also means that we can surface this information to content authors, so that they can be aware of the problem.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>AppArmor only works in Linux, and cannot run on Linux guest Docker containers on a macOS host machine. This makes it difficult for developers running macOS to develop and test features related to sandboxed code execution. WebAssembly can run on any major operating system.</paragraph>
