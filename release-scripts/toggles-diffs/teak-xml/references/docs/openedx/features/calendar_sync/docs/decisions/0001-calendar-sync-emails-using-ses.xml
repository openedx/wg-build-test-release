            <paragraph>For calendar sync functionality, we would like to send users
                emails with .ics file attachments, which will in turn allow the user
                to easily add/update course deadline dates on their personal calendars.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>We will use Amazon SES to send these emails.  Originally, we had hoped to use
                Sailthru, but found that file attachments were not supported.  While emails
                with attachments are not currently sent from platform at the time this doc is
                being written, they are however sent from other services such as
                enterprise-data using Amazon SES.  We will use a similar approach for our
                calendar sync feature.</paragraph>
