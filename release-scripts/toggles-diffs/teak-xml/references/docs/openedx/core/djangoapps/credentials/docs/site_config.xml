            <paragraph>Controls whether the LMS integrates with the Learner Records feature in Credentials. Specifically, this turns on some web buttons that link to a learner’s record on the Credentials IDA and enables some data being passed to Credentials related to those records.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If you have had this disabled and decide to enable it, you will need to backpopulate the data that was not sent while the feature was disabled. Look into running the <literal>notify_credentials</literal> management command.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Note that Credentials has a similar site config option that you’ll want to keep in sync with this setting.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Default is <literal>True</literal>.</paragraph>
