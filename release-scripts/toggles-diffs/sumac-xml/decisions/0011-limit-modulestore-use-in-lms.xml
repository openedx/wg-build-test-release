            <paragraph>Django apps deployed in the LMS sometimes want to make queries about course team authored content, like sequences, units, and problems. To do this, they often use the Modulestore, which can return parts of the course as a graph of XBlocks. Unfortunately, the Modulestore is a large, complex system that is shared by many features. This has been the cause of many bugs and performance issues over the years. Modulestore performance has been gradually improved over the years, but at the cost of adding even more complexity.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The courseware app is the exception to this rule, because it requires Modulestore access to render the Unit with the XBlock runtime, and extracting that logic would require too much effort at this time.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Modulestore often has obscure edge cases like non-standard course hierarchies, inheritable attributes set in places where Studio would not normally offer it as an option, A/B tests at the section level, etc. However, LMS-oriented relational data schemas like <literal>course_overviews</literal> and <literal>learning_sequences</literal> make intentional, documented assumptions about course data. LMS app authors can confidently build on these simpler models without having to mind the complex flexibility of Modulestore data.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Modulestore grabs large chunks of the course at once, leading to major variability in performance in small vs. large courses, or in courses where certain advanced features have been enabled. Serving LMS requests from simpler application data models will make the operational behavior much more predictable. The eventual goal would be to access Modulestore only during the authoring and publishing steps, and never when serving content to students.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>CourseOverviews and UserCourseOutlineData objects are much easier to create and mock for testing purposes than a tree of XBlocks, and do not suffer from complicated publishing rules. Using the modulestore also imposes a substantial performance penalty when creating and modifying courses, making modulestore access the dominant part of the edx-platform test suite running time.</paragraph>

                    <definition>
                        <paragraph>Many features today are at least partially implemented in Modulestore and the XBlocks that it returns. Changes in those features can cause bugs that ripple out into completely unrelated features being developed by other teams.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If an LMS application queries the Modulestore when responding to a user request, then unexpected failures in shared Modulestore code will cause user-facing errors. A feature that reads Modulestore data at the time of course publish and pushes it into its own data model will still be affected by Modulestore-related bugs, but it will result in stale data and not an entirely broken experience.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>It is possible that smaller apps like <literal>course_overviews</literal> and <literal>learning_sequences</literal> could be extracted from edx-platform and become their own app repositories. When that happens, an app that lives in its own repository could include those smaller apps as dependencies, simplifying the setup and running of tests. Modulestore has proven to be much more challenging to extract in this way, and any external apps relying on the modulestore will be forced to use dependency inversion mechanisms that are more vulnerable to breaking as edx-platform evolves. This will also advance our long term plans for separating Studio and the LMS into more separate systems.</paragraph>

                <title>Course Settings</title>
                <paragraph>Apps that only query the Modulestore for course settings that are stored on the root CourseBlock should be modified to query CourseOverviews instead. This is available from <literal>openedx.core.djangoapps.content.course_overview.api</literal>, which has the <literal>get_course_overview</literal> and <literal>get_course_overviews</literal> functions.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>This will cause a performance penalty on initial rollout.

                <title>Advanced Use Cases</title>
                <paragraph>Sometimes the data an application needs just isn’t available in a performant way in the LMS. When this happens, you’ll need to create your own model for this data in your application, and then push new data to it during the course publish process. To demonstrate how this can work, let’s walk through the implementation of Learning Sequences, which follows this general architectural pattern.</paragraph>
                <section ids="studio-process" names="studio\ process">
                    <title>Studio Process</title>
                    <paragraph>The code to extract data from the Modulestore and convert it into a format that the Learning Sequences app understands lives in the <literal>cms.djangoapps.contentstore</literal> package. This has several pieces:</paragraph>
                    <definition_list>
                        <definition_list_item>
                            <term>Data Extraction</term>
                            <definition>
                                <paragraph><literal>cms.djangoapps.contentstore.outlines.get_outline_from_modulestore</literal></paragraph>
                                <paragraph>The <literal>get_outline_from_modulestore</literal> function and its helpers does the work of actually extracting course structure and content data from the Modulestore. It’s where we have to account for any weird edge cases, like malformed course structures.</paragraph>
                                <paragraph>Note that this function has no side-effects. To make testing easier, it’s purely about extracting content and converting it to the <literal>CourseOutlineData</literal> objects that Learning Sequences understands. The test cases in <literal>OutlineFromModuleStoreTestCase</literal> then only have to worry about setting up Modulestore course structures and validating that they generate the expected <literal>CourseOutlineData</literal>.</paragraph>
                                <paragraph>You’ll also want to be careful to make sure you’re only pulling from the published branch when you extract this data (saving a draft also generates a <literal>course_published</literal> event). You can force a read from the publish branch by
                                    writing something like:</paragraph>
                                <literal_block force="False" language="default" linenos="False" xml:space="preserve">from xmodule.modulestore import ModuleStoreEnum
from xmodule.modulestore.django import modulestore

# ...

store = modulestore()
with store.branch_setting(ModuleStoreEnum.Branch.published_only, course_key):
    course = store.get_course(course_key, depth=3)</literal_block>
                                <paragraph>Finally, keep in mind that your code will run asynchronously after the the user has pressed the publish button or run course import. That means that you should be forgiving of the input to a certain degree, and not simply fail the process because you encounter bad course data. On the other hand, it’s important to keep this part of the code as a strong anti-corruption layer. We don’t want to let unnecessary complexity and obscure data configurations leak into our application’s core data model.</paragraph>
                                <paragraph>The compromise that Learning Sequences takes is to elevate content errors to a first-class concept. The Modulestore data extraction code returns not only the <literal>CourseOutlineData</literal>, but a list of <literal>ContentErrorData</literal> objects as well.</paragraph>
                                <paragraph>For example, Learning Sequences assumes that a Sequence exists in only one Section in the Course. This simplifying assumption is baked into the data model and URLs structure of the <literal>learning_sequences</literal> app, but it’s not a constraint that Modulestore imposes on courses. So our approach should be to create a <literal>ContentErrorData</literal> whenever we see this happen, and skip over all but the first occurance of the Sequence. The data model for Learning Sequences remains simple, and there is some representation of what went wrong that could be used by course teams or support staff to diagnose any problems later.</paragraph>

It’s critical to use celery to do this work asynchronously.

                    <paragraph>In the LMS process, your feature should not use the Modulestore at all. Your LMS app’s code should be entirely free of Modulestore dependencies. All of the Modulestore-facing code described above should live in the <literal>./cms/</literal> source tree and run in the Studio process. By the time your LMS request is happening, your app is only looking at its own data models, or one of the performant Modulestore-alternative APIs.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>You should not allow the LMS process to overwrite models written to by the course publishing process, and you should absolutely not let the LMS push data back into the Modulestore. If your application needs to be able to override data that comes from publishing, have two separate models–one that’s only ever updated by course content publishing, and one that’s read/write from the LMS. When answering queries, your app can look at both models. The edx-when app works in this way, capturing start and due date information from the Modulestore, but then applying student-specific overrides when serving requests in the LMS.

                    <paragraph>The Django admin for the <literal>learning_sequences</literal> app is read-only, and is intended to give support and engineering an easier view into the state of what’s on production. We are planning to add the backfill task as an action to a new Django admin page in the contentstore Studio app, using a proxy model to CourseOverview in order to get the listing of courses.</paragraph>
