            <paragraph>There has been disagreement over whether Open edX’s content authoring Web service is called “CMS” or “Studio”.</paragraph>

            <title>Context</title>
            <paragraph>edx-platform contains two semi-coupled Django projects. Although the projects share a lot of code and data, they have two different Django entry points and are generally deployed as distinct Web services.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Django project defined under the <literal>./lms</literal> directory has many responsibilities, but its cardinal role is to host the instructor- and learner-facing learning experience. The Web service deployed from it is consistently referred to as “LMS” (for Learning Management System).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Django project defined under the <literal>./cms</literal> directory is responsible for authoring, versioning, and publishing learning content to LMS. The Web service deployed from it was originally named “CMS” (for Content Management System). The primary user-facing Web application that it powers is named “Studio”. Other applications include LabXChange, which uses the service’s APIs to power content authoring capabilities.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In the past, there had been a push to update code references from “CMS” to “Studio”, in an effort to (a) match the Studio product and (b) disambiguate the service from the Drupal CMS, which was being used internally to manage edX’s marketing site. However, this effort was never fully followed through upon, and both names for the service can be found throughout code old and new, with different Open edX community members expressing preferences for one name or the other.</paragraph>
            <section ids="let-s-choose-one-name-for-the-web-service" names="let's\ choose\ one\ name\ for\ the\ web\ service">
                <title>Let’s choose one name for the Web service</title>
                <paragraph>Having two names for the same thing is annoying, especially when that thing is a core component of a software ecosystem. Whenever a developer needs to reference CMS/Studio, either in code or in documentation, they must arbitrarily choose one name or the other. Often, they will have to justify why they chose one name over the other to reviewers, who may have mixed opinions on which name to use. This is a waste of time, and the end result is that our code is more confusing and less predictable.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>“CMS” is a generic term for software that creates and edits digital content (see: Wordpress, Wagtail, et al), and thus may be ambiguous as a name for the content authoring service.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The CMS/Studio service supports at least one major product other than Studio: LabXChange.

            <paragraph>We will call the Web service “CMS”. Going forward, “Studio” should only be used to refer to the user-facing content authoring product powered by CMS. The primary factor behind this decision was an understanding that it would be significantly easier to change references of “Studio” to “CMS” than it would be to go the opposite direction.</paragraph>
