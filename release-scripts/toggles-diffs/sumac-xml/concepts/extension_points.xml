        <title refid="id2">Options for Extending the edX Platform</title>
        <paragraph>Open edX platform development follows the <reference name="Open-Closed Principle" refuri="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle">Open-Closed Principle</reference>: we want Open edX to be an extensible platform that allows developers to build extensions that integrate with the core of the platform. This allows the core to remain small, while volatile extensions remain in the periphery.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As you can see in this document, there are many different ways to integrate with Open edX. However, we know that there are still some features/integrations that are not possible today without modifying the core. If you have such a need, please consider proposing a new extension point in the core that would make possible the functionality you have in mind. When you submit a pull request for a new extension point, be sure to include a change to this file to document your new extension point. (Doing so will also notify reviewers that want to help with making the platform more extensible.)</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Throughout this document, we will refer to the <strong>Status</strong> (<strong>Adoption</strong> and <strong>Completion</strong>) of each specific integration point. The Completion refers to how complete and stable an integration point is: either “Limited” (incomplete, or unstable) or “Stable” (complete and stable enough for general use in some or all cases). Adoption shows how the integration point is currently being used, and whether or not it should be used in the future:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Be aware that most existing REST APIs are not considered stable, and some platform features lack a REST API. We welcome help as we work to standardize our API practices and version them to create API stability.</paragraph>

                                <paragraph>XBlocks are python plugins specific to Open edX that get installed into edx-platform and can be used to build courses. An XBlock defines a new <emphasis>type</emphasis> of interactive component, and authors can then create many instances of that content type in their courses (each with different settings and content). If you only need to support Open edX, XBlocks provide the best user experience. Open edX operators must install an XBlock into their Open edX instance before it can be used. See the <reference name="XBlock tutorial" refuri="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/xblock-tutorial/en/latest/">XBlock tutorial</reference> to learn more about XBlocks.</paragraph>

                                <paragraph>Learning Tools Interoperability is a standard that allows an individual piece of learnable/interactive content (the “tool”) to be embedded via an IFrame in a host Learning Platform (the “consumer”) such as Open edX. Open edX supports LTI content in both directions: <reference name="as a consumer" refuri="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/lti_component.html">as a consumer</reference> (external content appearing in an Open edX course) and <reference name="as a provider" refuri="https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/configuration/lti/">as a provider</reference> (Open edX course content appearing in an external Learning Platform). If you need to support multiple Learning Platforms, and not just Open edX, LTI is usually the best way to integrate your content. Note that not all LTI versions/features are supported, however.</paragraph>

                                <paragraph>A “Learning Context” is a course, a library, a program, a blog, an external site, or some other collection of content where learning happens. If you are trying to build a totally new learning experience that’s not a type of course, you may need to implement a new learning context. Learning contexts are a new abstraction and are only supported in the nascent Learning-Core-based XBlock runtime. Since existing courses use modulestore instead of Learning Core, they are not yet implemented as learning contexts. However, Learning-Core-based content libraries are.

                <paragraph>If you need a <emphasis>very</emphasis> custom look and feel for your users, and you have the time and resources required for a huge project, you can consider creating a custom frontend for Open edX, which is a completely separate application that runs on its own domain and integrates with Open edX using REST APIs. The edX Mobile App can be thought of as an example of a separate frontend that connects to Open edX using only REST APIs. Another example is <reference name="LabXchange" refuri="https://www.labxchange.org/">LabXchange</reference><target ids="labxchange" names="labxchange" refuri="https://www.labxchange.org/"></target>. If you develop your custom frontend using Django, you may wish to use the <reference name="auth-backends" refuri="https://github.com/openedx/auth-backends">auth-backends</reference><target ids="auth-backends" names="auth-backends" refuri="https://github.com/openedx/auth-backends"></target> django plugin for user authentication.</paragraph>
