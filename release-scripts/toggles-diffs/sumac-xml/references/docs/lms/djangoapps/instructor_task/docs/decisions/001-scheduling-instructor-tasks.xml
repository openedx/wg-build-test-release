            <paragraph>One of the most requested features in edx-platform has been the ability to schedule an email message to be sent at a specified date and time through the Instructor Dashboard’s Bulk Course Email tool. These email messages are sent as an instructor task. Today, edx-platform does not have the ability to support scheduling of instructor tasks. When an instructor task is created we attempt to execute the task immediately.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This ADR covers details on the proposed modeling of a scheduled instructor task. A subsequent ADR will focus on the processing of scheduled instructor tasks.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>This new model that will be responsible for tracking the due date of an instructor task, as well as some information needed to process the tasks later. The model will have two fields:</paragraph>
                <bullet_list bullet="*">

                        <paragraph><strong>due</strong> (DateTime): The date and time (in UTC) to execute the associated task.</paragraph>

                    <list_item>
                        <paragraph><strong>task_args</strong> (TextField): This will store information required to execute the task when due. The source data is in the form of a dictionary that will be converted to text for storage in the database.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>A OneToOne relationship is specified on the <literal>InstructorTaskSchedule</literal> model in order to avoid modifying the core <literal>InstructorTask</literal> model. An instructor task is a one-time task that should only ever have a single schedule attributed to it.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>The <literal>InstructorTask</literal> model currently uses two custom states (<strong>QUEUEING</strong> and <strong>PROGRESS</strong>) to help describe the current status of a task. We will introduce a new state, <strong>SCHEDULED</strong>, to represent the status of an instructor task that has been created but hasn’t been executed yet.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Scheduled tasks will be periodically retrieved by use of this status while determining if they should be executed.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>Celery provides two <reference name="optional arguments" refuri="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/calling.html?highlight=countdown#eta-and-countdown">optional arguments</reference> (<strong>eta</strong> and <strong>countdown</strong>) that can delay the execution of a task.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph><strong>eta</strong>: A specific date and time describing the earliest moment a task should be executed.</paragraph>

                </bullet_list>
                <paragraph>The Celery worker process holds these delayed tasks in memory aside from any non-delayed tasks. This can be memory intensive. We found several well documented accounts of performance issues related to using these options. Unless the tasks are only delayed for just a few minutes, it seems best to avoid this solution.</paragraph>

                <title>Object Inheritance</title>
                <paragraph>We considered creating a new <literal>ScheduledInstructorTask</literal> model that inherits from the existing <literal>InstructorTask</literal> model. After reading about how Django treats model inheritance, we decided against this route. Using (single-table or multi-table) inheritance didn’t provide any clear or discernable advantages (and there were plenty of documented reasons <emphasis>not</emphasis> to use a multi-table inheritance approach).</paragraph>
