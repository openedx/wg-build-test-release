                <paragraph>This doc was written long after this app was created, thus explaining the past tense in language below.</paragraph>
            </note>
            <paragraph>When this was created, the only way to add another app to lms/cms was to create the app in edx-platform repo. This was untenible due to already large size of edx-platform and adding another app increased the chance of further entanglement between the different apps.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>This would make it easier to move code for some critical/key apps outside of edx-platform and into their on repository. It would also make it easier to add further functionality into lms/cms without needing to change any code in edx-platform.</paragraph>
