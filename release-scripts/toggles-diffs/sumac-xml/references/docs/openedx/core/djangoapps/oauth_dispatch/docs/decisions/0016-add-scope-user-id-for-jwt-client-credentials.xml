            <title>Context</title>
            <paragraph>This ADR builds upon ADR 0015: Add Scope user_id for JWT Token. It inherits the context from that ADR, including the initial addition of the user_id claim for analytics and the rationale for using a scope to control its inclusion.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>However, this ADR focuses specifically on the enterprise context highlighted in the consequences of ADR 0015. External organizations often utilize the LMS API with the grant_type: client_credentials to request tokens on behalf of their users. These tokens are crucial for enterprise integrations and require access to the user’s user_id for proper functionality.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Based on <reference name="0005-restricted-application-for-SSO" refuri="0005-restricted-application-for-SSO.rst">0005-restricted-application-for-SSO</reference> and <reference name="0006-enforce-scopes-in-LMS-APIs" refuri="0006-enforce-scopes-in-LMS-APIs.rst">0006-enforce-scopes-in-LMS-APIs</reference> ADRs, it may be that the original purpose of the user_id scope was to protect against leakage of the user_id in the case of some combination of Authorization Grant and Restricted Applications. More investigation would be required to refactor based on this context, but it may be useful for future iterations.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The current implementation requires clients to remember to request using the scope, which is not a trustworthy solution.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Adding all allowable scopes as default: Including all allowable scopes by default, which would include the user_id scope, would not follow the principle of least privilege and would make every default token have more access than required. Instead, we will minimize the additional access.</paragraph>

Deferring this option allows for further analysis of potential security implications and user experience trade-offs.</paragraph>
