            <paragraph>In the Credentials service, certificate_available_date is called visible_date.
                Whenever a generatedCertificate is updated or saved the first time, it sets
                the visible date to certificate available date (available in studio settings).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There is a limitation in our code, if course team decides to change the
                certificate_available_date it is not reflected in the credentials service
                for all the certificates that were awarded before that change and have been
                pushed to credentials service. The certificatesâ€™ dates need to be in sync on
                both places.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>This has caused problems when a learner is able to see the certificate on
                their dashboard but the change is not reflected on their learner record in
                credential service.</paragraph>

            <title>Decision</title>
            <paragraph>Whenever a CourseUpdate is made with change to the certificate_available_date,
                the system updates the certificate visible_date on the credential service.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>To achieve this, a signal is created to listen to any course update signal that
                contains change in certificate_available_date and start a task to compute all
                certificates that have been issued.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>We will then reuse the award_course_certificate task for every certificate user
                and get their visible_date updated on credential service to keep dates in sync
                on both ends.</paragraph>

            <title>Consequences</title>
            <paragraph>The system will have to process each issued user certificate and update the
                visible_date for all of them individually as visible_date is an attribute for
                every UserCredential object on credential service.</paragraph>
