            <paragraph>The library_content block is an existing block type which allows users to include a specified number of blocks into a course, randomly picked per-learner from a “V1” (modulestore-backed) content library, optionally filtered by the blocks’ <literal>capa_type</literal> (only applicable to <literal>problem</literal> blocks). We are incrementally improving this feature:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>We are soon adding support for “V2” (blockstore-backed) content libraries to the library_content block. This will enable an improved library authoring experience and assist our transition away from modulestore and MongoDB. We need this not to break existing usages of the library_content block, and we need there to be a period of simultaneous V1/V2 support overlap to enable a reversible migration of libraries from modulestore to blockstore. Eventually, V1 support will be removed.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>Next, we want to add support for non-randomized, hand-picked reference of library blocks. This is is a highly requested feature across the community.</paragraph>

                <list_item>
                    <paragraph>In the future, we would like to support other modes: in particular, we want authors to eventually be able to hand-pick a set of blocks from a library, and <emphasis>then</emphasis> have the LMS randomly select a specified number of blokcs for each learner.</paragraph>
                </list_item>
            </bullet_list>
            <paragraph>We need to choose how to evolve the schema of the library_content block to support all of these incremental improvements. This is the current schema:</paragraph>

            <paragraph>We will introduce the support for a “manual selection mode”, without explicitly making it <emphasis>mode</emphasis> as hinted at by the old block schema. This will lead to a cleaner and more flexible implementation. We will achieve this with two new boolean settings: <strong>manual</strong> and <strong>shuffle</strong>:</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>When manual is <emphasis>disabled</emphasis> and shuffle is <emphasis>enabled</emphasis>, the block will behave as it did before. That is, it will import the entire library (filtered by capa_type) as its children, and present each user a random subset based on max_count. For backwards compatibility, these will be the default value of the settings.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>When manual is <emphasis>enabled</emphasis>, any filter fields (currently just capa_type, but perhaps more in the future) will be ignored for the purposes of CMS deciding which blocks to import. That’s because in the event that manually-picked children clash with the filters, we need to decide who would “win”, and we are deciding here that the manually-picked children would win. However, we could choose to have the block-picker filter blocks based on filters.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph><strong>Utilize the “mode” field to distinguish between random, manual, and any future modes.</strong> This suffers from a matrix problem: with any given block behavior, it is possible that combination of those behaviors is a desirable “mode”. For example, combining random and manual modes into a “random-from-manual-selection” is a desired future feature, but that new mode overlaps in functionality with both random and manual modes; in fact, random and manual modes would most just be special-cases of random-from-manual-selection mode. If the block were ever to be extended to incorporate, for example, recommendations, that would further multiply the available modes. The resulting code and interface would be harder to reason about than the flat list of flags and features that we decide on here.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph><strong>Implement V2 support in a separate block rather than the existing block.</strong> This would make it harder to automatically migrate all modulestore libraries into blockstore, as all usages of the V1 library_content block would still exist. The <literal>library_sourced</literal> block was an implementation in this direction, but we deleted it.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph><strong>Implement non-randomized modes in a separate block.</strong> This would yield a less flexible user experience, as it would force authors to pick from two separate blocks in the Studio UI depending on whether they want random or non-randomized (which is still feasible with the ADR’s direction, but is not mandatory). Furthermore, it would create duplicated logic between the two blocks on the backend, increasing bug surface area. The <literal>library_sourced</literal> block was an implementation in this direction, but we deleted it.</paragraph>
