### Things that _can be done_ before the release is cut
- [ ] find the date for the previous release (for Olive, this was October 11, 2022)
- [ ] find the date for the next release (for Palm, this was April xx, 2022)
- [ ] Create a wiki page for the _next_ release, on the [Open edX Release Planning](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/13205845) wiki page ([Redwood](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3890380898/Next+Release+Redwood))
### Things to do after the release is cut
- [ ] add an appropriate TOC to the release notes
- [ ] add any items from the [Pending Release wiki page](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3726802953/Pending+Release+Quince)
- [ ] Review and incorporate any feature posts from [edX Partner announcements](https://partners.edx.org/announcements)
- [ ] Review and incorporate any feature posts from the [open edX blog](https://open.edx.org/category/blog/)
- [ ] Review commit messages from relevant repos. [Dinghy](https://github.com/nedbat/dinghy) seems like a useful tool for this. I used this config [olive-dinghy.yaml](https://gist.github.com/pdpinch/a1749421cc2af23f9d9a2335e065489b)
- [ ] Review [DEPR tickets ](https://openedx.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=452)
- [ ] Diff the technical documentation and build a list of links to both new and removed settings. 
### Meta tasks
- [ ] Review and update this checklist
