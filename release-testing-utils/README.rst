This is a place to put course exports or other helpful resources for executing named release tests.

When adding a file or folder here, please name it using the "UNIQUE ID" from the release testing spreadsheet. For example, a course export for `TC_DEVOPS_16` could be called `tc-devops-16.tar.gz`. (If you see a file or folder here named for a non-existent unique test ID, then that test case has probably been deleted, thus the file or folder is safe to remove).
