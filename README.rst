================================
Role definitions and assignments
================================

*Current release: Maple*

The following roles, with corresponding expectations and assignments, are
defined for the current release cycle.

The following applies to all roles:

* Communication between assignees that is pertinent to their roles must be done
  publicly so it can be linked to, preferrably via:
  * The [Build-Test-Release category](https://discuss.openedx.org/c/working-groups/build-test-release/30) in the forum.
  * Github issues or PRs.
  * The [group's Slack channel](https://openedx.slack.com/archives/C01AGTSB1LL).
* If communication is done via video or audio, it must be recorded and posted
  to one of the above.

Group Chair
===========

*Current assignee: @BbrSofiane*

The group chair is responsible for coordinating efforts that culminate in
getting a new release out and maintaining the current one.  In particular, the
Group Chair will:

* Manage the current release cycle in general, including making sure that
  proper deadlines are established and adhered to.
* Facilitate the assignment of roles and tasks.
* Coordinate the group's communication efforts, including running periodic
  meetings such as the Biweekly Meetup, and summarizing recent happenings in
  the Biweekly Update.
* Try and help solve problems as they come up, bringing them to the attention
  of the right group members.

Release Manager
===============

*Current assignees: @regisb*

The Release Manager is responsible for the actual cutting of a release, which,
in essence, includes following the steps in the `Process to Create an Open edX Release
<https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/19662426/Process+to+Create+an+Open+edX+Release>`_.

In addition, the Release Manager will:

* Create public test or release candidate branches as required by the release process.
* Merge reviewed PRs into the release master branch (for instance,
  ``open-release/koa.master``).
* Notify the Release Testing Coordinator whenever additional testing is needed
  in response to the above.
* Tag releases, major and minor, at the appropriate time.

Release Testing Coordinator
===========================

*Current assignee: @jfavellar90*

The Release Testing Coordinator is responsible for making sure release
candidates are tested _before_ a tag is made.  The coordinator does not
necessarily have to run tests themselves, but they will:

* Coordinate testing in general, in particular in the days leading to a timed
  release, including the bimonthly minor ones.
* Keep tabs on whatever CI is available, making sure it is running correctly.
* Advocate for better testing tools and environments, when necessary.
* Coordinate the reaction to test failures, such as bringing them to the
  attention of the rest of the group by opening tickets or commenting in the forum.
* Communicate results of testing to the rest of the group.

Release Documentation Expert
============================

*Current assignee: @pdpinch*

The Release Documentation Expert is tasked with building the Release Notes
document prior to a major release.  It involves:

* On a best-effort basis, track down relevant information, including but not
  limited to:
  * Reviewing commits and pull requests across Open edX repositories.
  * Collecting a summary of new features from the edX Product organization.
* Writing a draft document and posting it for community review as a PR to
  [edx-documentation](https://github.com/edx/edx-documentation/tree/master/en_us/open_edx_release_notes/source)
  with sufficient lead time prior to a release.
* Adjusting it as per the former review, and finally releasing a final version
  concomittantly with the major release itself.

Bug Triager
===========

*Current assignee: @arbrandes*

The group's Bug Triager is, in a nutshell, responsible for proper use of
the group's `issue board
<https://github.com/openedx/build-test-release-wg/projects/1>`_.  In
particular, they will:

* Review incoming issues and ensure they have been processed accordingly (to be
  specified separately).
* Assist in making sure any known release bugs are tracked with individual
  issues.  For example, if a known bug is not currently tracked, they will
  create an issue for it with relevant information.
* Bring the group's attention to any issues that warrant immediate action.
* Help ping assignees when milestone deadlines are approaching.


Community Liaison
=================

*Current assignee: @DennisBates*

The Build-Test-Release Community Liaison(s) will:

* Assist the Group Chair in communicating the group's progress in the forum.
* Take minutes of the BTR Biweekly Meetup and share them in the forum.
* Periodically reply to community communication in the Build-Test-Release
  category.
* Be on the lookout for any forum posts (not only on the
  Build-Test-Release working group category) that credibly report
  release-breaking issues, and communicate the issues to the `Bug
  Triager<#bug-triager>`_.
